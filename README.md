Simple website created using html css

This website covers the basic HTML5 and CSS3 concepts. Using marquees, tables, hyperlinks, and basic html tags like <div>, <p>, <br> 
etc, lists, unordered lists I have developed a few html pages. The styling of these pages is done using ids and classes in CSS.
